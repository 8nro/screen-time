<h3>Shortsploit</h3>
<p>A workaround to Apple's screen time.</p>

> [!NOTE]
> This bypass only allows access to websites in their desktop form running in an embedded WebView browser on the home screen.

<ol>
<li>Download Apple's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334">Shortcuts app</a>.</li>
<li>Find <code>Shortcuts</code> in the settings app and enable <code>Private Sharing</code>.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/132cccd52fa042f999a4dae4bfbb9d3d">Shortsploit shortcut</a>.</li>
<br>

> [!WARNING]
> It is highly recommended to use this hack after your screen time is depleted, as it still counts as screen time on the home screen.

<li>Open the <a href="shortcuts://open-shortcut?name=Shortsploit">Shortsploit shortcut in Shortcuts</a>.</li>
<li>Click the <code>â“˜ (Circled latin small letter i)</code> on the shortcut settings and click <code>Add to Home screen</code> and follow the instructions.</li>
<li>Now whenever you feel like browsing the web when your screen time is over, just click the Shortsploit icon on the home screen and start surfing the web!</li>
<br>

> [!TIP]
> It is possble diguise Shortsploit as a seperate app if you download the app icon you wish to disguise it as from the web and set it as its icon and name.
